# SFML Screensaver
This served as a simple test to see if I could singlehandedly learn to use a C++ library, using only the online official documentation, to create something of relative interest. </br>
With that in mind, I created this funky program!

## How does it work?
I simply applied a constant speed for all the points of the square to move, with only 2 directions: down and right. When the coordinates of one of the corners are the same as the borders of the program, it reverses the speed of that direction, making it move around! </br>
Then I also applied a constant loop to change the square's RGB values individually in a way that makes it cycle through a wide range of colours in a smooth manner! </br></br>

### Fun Fact
After having created a functioning version of this, I managed to **win an award** for this program in my college.
I was awarded **Best Software**.
